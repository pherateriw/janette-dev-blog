# My Dev Blog
I set this site up to learn a bit more about Go, CMS's, and frontend development. I used [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/) with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) and the [m10c theme](https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c). Github Pages is the hosting provider, and I use Github Actions for CI/CD. More improvements to come!

## TODOs
- post tags
- unit tests and better code style
- images not checked into the repo
- my own theme?
