You can find the source code for this site [on github](https://github.com/pherateriw/janette-dev-blog "ongithub"). I used [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/) with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) and the [m10c theme](https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c). I'll talk more about hosting and deployment in a follow-up post. 

This site has been in active development for .... has it really only been a week?? It has seemed much longer. Not gonna lie, I had some struggles. I'll talk about those in the Struggles section. But first, the things that actually worked for me!

## How it was made

First step, [set up a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo "setuprepo") on Github (or Git platform of choice)
