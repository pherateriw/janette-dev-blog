title: Designing a New Application!
draft: true
---

So far this blog has been pretty recursive, a blog about the development of this blog. That is changing today! I'm very excited to start showing my design thinking for a new application. I'm going to walk you through the overall architecture and tech stack of [neatskulls.dev](https://neatskulls.dev "neatskulls.dev"). Check out the source code at [https://github.com/pherateriw/animal-skull-morphology.](https://github.com/pherateriw/animal-skull-morphology)

I'm going to start with the basics, my motivation for building the app, what the app will do, and how it should behave. Next we'll go into the choices I've made on the tech stack and why. Finally, I'll talk about my struggles with indecision and a little wrap up.
