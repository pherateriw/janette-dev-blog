You can find the source code for this site [on github](https://github.com/pherateriw/janette-dev-blog "ongithub"). I used [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/ "tina") with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) and the [m10c theme](https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c). I'll talk more about hosting and deployment in a follow-up post.

This site has been in active development for .... has it really only been a week?? It has seemed much longer. Not gonna lie, I had some struggles. I'll talk about those in the Struggles section. But first, the things that actually worked for me!

## How it was made

First, [set up a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo "setuprepo") on Github (or Git platform of choice). Also make sure you have Node.js and npm [installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm "nodesetup").
Finally, set up an IDE of your choice (I use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

### Setting up TinaCMS

Now that you have a repo, node, and an IDE, it's time to set up TinaCMS.

1. Run npx create-tina-app@latest
2. Follow the prompts (note that a lot of TinaCMS docs use yarn as the package manager, so maybe consider using yarn instead). ![](</uploads/Screenshot 2023-06-07 at 10.39.38 PM.png>)
3.
