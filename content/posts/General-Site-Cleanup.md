After Creating the site \<TODO link> and Deploying the site \<TODO link> there were still a number of things I wanted to tweak, all minor. However, I had to move on to \<other project> for the sake of my brain. This is a big wrap-up post discussing all of the minor tweaks I made to get this site working how I want. Today we are going to cover: 

* Using branches and pull requests (and other good git hygiene) within TinaCMS
* Removing the images from source control and hosting them on \<TODO decision>
* Swapping out and customizing themes in Hugo
* Updating the TinaCMS graphql schema
* Adding analytics
* Possibly other things TBD
