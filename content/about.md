# Hi there

Hi! My name is Janette and this is my website. Specifically, this is my development blog where I will post about my development projects.

## About Me

I'm a software engineer, with a background in wildlife science and an interest in all things STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics). I blog, I make weird little apps, and occasionally I paint or embroider things. Hope you enjoy!
