<h2 id="how-it-was-made">How it was made</h2>
<p>You can find the source code for this site <a href="https://github.com/pherateriw/janette-dev-blog" title="ongithub">on github</a>. I used <a href="https://tina.io/" title="tina">Tina CMS</a> with <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">Hugo</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c">m10c theme</a>. I&rsquo;ll talk more about hosting and deployment in a follow-up post.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo" title="setuprepo">set up a repo</a> on Github (or Git platform of choice). Also make sure you have Node.js and npm <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" title="nodesetup">installed</a>.
Finally, set up an IDE of your choice (I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">vscode</a>)</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-tinacms-and-hugo">Setting up TinaCMS and Hugo</h3>
<p>Now that you have a repo, node, and an IDE, it&rsquo;s time to set up TinaCMS. I used the starter.</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>npx create-tina-app@latest</code></li>
<li>Follow the prompts (note that a lot of TinaCMS docs use yarn as the package manager, so maybe consider using yarn instead). <img src="../../uploads/Screenshot%202023-06-07%20at%2010.39.38%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot of CLI which reads &ldquo;Which package manager would you like to use? NPM. What is your project named? janette-demo. What starter code would you like to use? Hugo Starter&rdquo;" title="TinaCLI"></li>
<li><strong>Important!</strong> In the package json, add <code>--destination ./static</code> to the build command after <code>hugo</code>. (I will discuss why in the Struggles section). <img src="../../uploads/Screenshot%202023-06-07%20at%2010.51.47%20PM.png" alt="In the package json, add &ndash;destination ./static to the build command after hugo"></li>
<li><strong>Also Important!</strong> Configure Hugo to use relative paths by adding <code>relativeURLs = true</code> to the <code>config.toml</code> file, especially if you use <code>baseURL = '/'</code> (Again, see the Struggles section for why)</li>
<li>The setup instructions include a line about how this assumes you have Hugo running on your machine. I ran <code>brew install hugo</code> (windows set up instructions <a href="https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/">here</a>). However, hugo may or may not be running on the server you deploy your site to. So I&rsquo;d also recommend adding <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hugo-bin-extended">hugo-bin-extended</a> to your package.json file with <code>npm i hugo-bin-extended</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>npm run dev</code> and go to localhost:1313 in your browser. <img src="../../uploads/Screenshot%202023-06-08%20at%206.18.33%20PM.png" alt="Screen shot of a website with the title &ldquo;My New Hugo Site&rdquo; and some Lorem Ipsum" title="Hugo-starter generated site"></li>
<li>Create an account on TinaCMS cloud and set up a project, following <a href="https://tina.io/docs/tina-cloud/">this doc</a>. Once you have an account and a token generated for your project, you can then export the variables TINA_CLIENT_ID, TINA_TOKEN, and TINA_BRANCH with the values you created.</li>
<li>Run <code>npm run build</code></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="configuring-themes">Configuring Themes</h4>
<p>This is an optional step, but you can find different themes <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">here</a>. I used the <a href="https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c">m10c theme</a>. Setup is mostly the same as the README. Git will also ask you to run <code>git submodule add https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c themes/m10c</code> before pushing your local branch to github.</p>
<h2 id="struggles">Struggles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hugo&rsquo;s default destination for generated static pages is the ./public folder. This meant that all the stuff for TinaCMS was not added to the output folder. Adding <code>--destination ./static</code> to the hugo build command fixes this.</li>
<li>CSS/JS for the generated pages originally had incorrect paths in the html (e.g. <code>/&lt;css/file/path&gt;</code>). This meant that the site was deployed without any styling. I set <code>relativeURLs = true</code> , and now my site has styling.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>I hope this helped you set up your own TinaCMS and Hugo site. Next up, deploying sites on push to the main branch with Github Actions!</p>
