      <description>This site has been in active development for &amp;hellip;. has it really only been a week?? It has seemed much longer. Not gonna lie, I had some struggles. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about those in the Struggles section. But first, the things that actually worked for me!
How it was made You can find the source code for this site on github. I used Tina CMS with Hugo and the m10c theme. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about hosting and deployment in a follow-up post.</description>

      <description>The Struggle is Real While I am developing things, I sometimes struggle. I sometimes make the wrong decision and have to backtrack. Every other tutorial you&amp;rsquo;ve read was probably written by someone who also struggled with some things. All of the engineers I have worked with have struggled with code at one time or another. And here&amp;rsquo;s the thing, when you are learning to code, it often seems like everyone just somehow KNOWS what to do, that you are the only person in the world who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to do the thing.</description>

      <description>Hello World! Hi! My name is Janette and I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer. Welcome to my new blog! In my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve done a little bit of a lot of things, but I wanted to start doing deeper dives on some personal projects. You can find more about me and links to my other stuff on the About page.
This blog will mostly be about my personal development projects, with some other art and science stuff thrown in for spice.</description>
