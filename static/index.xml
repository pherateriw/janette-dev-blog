      <description>Hello World! Hi! My name is Janette and I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer. Welcome to my new blog! In my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve done a little bit of a lot of things, but I wanted to start doing deeper dives on some personal projects. You can find more about me and links to my other stuff on the About page.
This blog will mostly be about my personal development projects, with some other art and science stuff thrown in for spice.</description>
